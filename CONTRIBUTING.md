                    Contributing to Tech-Hub projects
==============================================================================
:+1::yipyip: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :yipyip::+1:  
If you'd like to report a bug or join in the development
of Tech-Hub, then here are some notes on how to do that.

## Reporting bugs and opening issues

If you'd like a report a bug or open an issue then please:

**Check if there is an existing issue.** If there is then please add
   any more information that you have, or give it a üëç.


When submitting an issue please describe the issue as clearly as possible, including how to
reproduce the bug, which situations it appears in, what you expected to happen, and what actually happens.
If you can include a screenshot for front end issues that is very helpful.

## Coding Guidelines

### Pull Requests
We love pull requests, so be bold with them! Don't be afraid of going ahead
and changing something, or adding a new feature. We're very happy to work with you
to get your changes merged into any of our projects.

If you've got an idea for a change then please discuss it in the open first, 
either by opening an issue, or by joining us in our [Telegram Page]
(\|  [![Telegram](https://telegram.org/img/t_logo.png)](https://t.me/joinchat/Fkwt1xJoduMWrku8r-JtqA))
or inbox the admins there [Telegram]. If no one is online[Expect it] then you can still leave a message that will hopefully get a reply
when we return.
